# ‚úèÔ∏è Overview
* Mega Cars is a `ASP.NET 6.0` web project in a SoftUni course. I started development in July 2023.
* ¬©Ô∏è It was created for student purposes. All images are copyrighted by the car companies.
* ¬©Ô∏è All videos are "free to use" from web sites for content creators.
* All items for correct web functionality are seeded.
*  The purpose of the site is for each of its users to browse, rent a car and buy merchandise.
      * *`As a first project, the style is a bit bad, but good practices are reserved.`*
